"Burial: Texas State Cemetery Austin Travis County Texas, USA ","Civil War Union Brigadier General. Governor of Texas. Edmund Davis was born to a respected family in St Augustine, Florida. He started his education there, moving in January of 1848 with his family to the boom town of Galveston, Texas where he studied law and worked as a clerk. The following year he moved to Corpus Christi and was admitted to the bar, then transferred to Laredo where he worked as a deputy customs collector until he was elected district attorney of the Twelfth Judicial District of Brownsville in 1853. He was named judge of the district in 1856, married Anne Britton in April 1858 and served as a state judge until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861; when he refused to swear allegiance to the Confederacy, he was removed from office. Because of his stand with the Union, he was forced to flee the state in May 1862 and made his way through New Orleans to Washington DC where he personally appealed to Abraham Lincoln to provide arms and troops to recapture Texas. Not only was he successful, but he received the position and rank of colonel and commander of the new First Texas Cavalry unit. He led his men through many battles: the fight at Galveston in January, 1863, where his unit barely escaped; his capture by the Confederates in Matamoros until the Mexican government intervened; fighting alongside General Nathaniel Banks during the Rio Grande campaign. After his unit successfully targeted the cotton trade along the border by seizing supplies and releasing slaves, he was promoted to brigadier general on November 4, 1864. From that point forward he commanded the cavalry in the Division of Western Mississippi. On June 2, 1865, he was one of the generals who accepted the terms of surrender of the Confederate forces in Texas. He returned to state politics after the war, representing the border district and attending the Constitutional Conventions of 1866, 1868 and 1869. In fall of 1869 he ran and won the position of Texas governor, implementing re-constructionist policies to help repair the damage that the Civil War had brought. He restored the state militia, reorganized the public school system, created the bureau of immigration and set up forts along the western frontier. All of these changes, though necessary, were very unpopular and he was not reelected when his term expired in 1874. From 1875 until his death, Davis was the head of the state Republican party, trying several times to gain reelection as governor or election to Congress, but to no avail. He was hoping for a cabinet position under President Chester A Arthur when he died in Austin; in recognition of his service, he was laid to rest with full honors in the Texas State Cemetery. His monument, erected by his brother, is the tallest and most massive of all. (bio by:  Screwtape) Family links: Parents:  William G.

"Burial: Arlington National Cemetery Arlington Arlington County Virginia, USA ","35th President of the United States, US Senator, US Congressman, Pulitzer Prize Winning Author. He was the older brother of US Attorney General and US Senator   Robert F. Bobby Kennedy and US Senator Edward M. Ted Kennedy. He was the   youngest elected US President and to date, the only Catholic to hold the office. The   second son of wealthy businessman Joseph Patrick Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald   Kennedy, he was born into a life of privilege but suffered from a variety of health   ailments including whooping cough, appendicitis and scarlet fever. His father taught   his children to be competitive in every aspect of life, but stressed the role of public   service. Young Jack was educated at private schools and after his father was   appointed US Ambassador to England, he studied at the London School of   Economics. Following his return to Massachusetts, he enrolled at Harvard   University and majored in Political Science with an emphasis on International   Relations while participating on the schools football and swim teams. He later   acquired experience while working as a secretary for his father in England. After the   United States entered World War II, he enlisted with the United States Navy. He rose   to the rank of lieutenant and was commander of the PT-109. During a patrol off the   Solomon Island, the boat was rammed in two by a Japanese destroyer resulting in   the deaths of two crewmen. The remaining personnel were tossed into the water.   Kennedy swam for four hours to a nearby island while towing an injured sailor by   his lifejacket. Kennedy decided to swim out on his own in order to find help and   after several more hours in the water, he reached another island where he came in   contact with local fishermen. He carved a message on a coconut and gave it to the   fishermen who in turn forwarded it to the allies. Kennedy and his crew were soon   rescued. The ordeal however, further damaged an already weakened back, which   hindered Kennedy for the remainder of his life. During the war, Kennedys older   brother Joseph Joe was killed in a plane crash. With Joe now gone, attention   shifted to Jack to be groomed for a political career and the ultimate goal, the   presidency. Recognized as a war hero, Kennedy ran for a local Democratic   Congressional seat and won. In 1952, he was elected US Senator from Massachusetts   and in 1953 he married the beautiful Jacqueline Lee Bouvier, the daughter of a   wealthy stockbroker, 12 years Kennedys junior. During the 1950s, the couple   gained national attention including an appearance on the Edward R. Murrow TV   interview program Person to Person. Kennedys popularity in the Senate grew to   the point where he was strongly considered to be a running mate for 1956   Democratic Presidential Nominee Adlai Stevenson. He received a Pulitzer Prize for   his book Profiles in Courage (1957). However for Kennedy, further health   complication arose including an ongoing battle with Addisons disease for which   often sapped his strength and vigor. For his chronic back pain, he received regular   injections of cortisone. In 1960, he launched his presidential campaign and   promised a new chapter in America for a new generation born in the 20th Century.   His Republican challenger was Vice President Richard Nixon. Their TV debate   became historic. While Nixon looked uncomfortable and unsure, Kennedy came off   as confident and focused. It is widely believed that the debate influenced many to be   in favor of Kennedy. The 1960 Presidential Election was decided by the narrowest of   margins (a little more than 100,000 votes) with Kennedy the winner. During his   inauguration speech he included the now-famous line Ask not what your country   can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. Kennedy did not have to wait   long for his first challenge. In April of 1961 tensions with Cubas dictator Fidel   Castro reached a breaking point. A plan was devised to liberate the country from   Castros ruling orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Kennedy   approved of the operation. The result was a total disaster and became what is   known as The Bay of Pigs. He learned from his mistakes and the following year   during October of 1962 a second situation with Cuba arose. The Soviet Union had   begun to establish missile sites within Cuba directed towards the United States. The   country faced a strong possibility of nuclear war with the Soviets. Over the next few   days several messages would go back and forth between Kennedy and Nikita   Khrushchev. Kennedy made a televised speech for implementing quarantine on   Cuba until the bases were dismantled. The Soviets backed down and removed the   sites. The event which is now known as The Cuban Missile Crisis showed   Kennedys ability to safely guide the United States away from what could have been   a world ending war. The remainder of his time in office saw the Civil Rights   Movement gain traction, a tense situation with Governor George Wallace of Alabama   who refused to let black students enter the University of Alabama for which resulted   in the need to use federal troops and the decision to further military programs in   Vietnam. Kennedy advanced the American space program in order to compete with   the Soviets. Additionally, he established the Peace Corps. Fear of losing southern   support in the South because of his policies towards Civil Rights led Kennedy to go   on a trip to Dallas, Texas. During a motorcade in Downtown, Dallas on November 22,   1963 accompanied by Mrs. Kennedy, Texas Governor John B. Connally and his wife   Nellie, Kennedy was fatally shot in the back of the neck and head. The country was   thrown into a state of mourning. Over the next two days, his flag draped casket   would lie in state at the US Capital. He was laid to rest at Arlington National   Cemetery on November 25, 1963. In the years since his death, details of alleged   extramarital affairs surfaced including encounters with movie star Marilyn Monroe.   Additionally, it is widely believed that Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged assassin did   not act alone. Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby shot Oswald to death on live   television two days after Kennedys death. This added to the speculation of a   conspiracy. No solid proof has ever supported such a theory. In spite of this, Kennedy   remains as one of the most popular presidents in American history. (bio by:  C.S.)

In 1973, he switched political parties, becoming a Republican, and ran unsuccessfully for the 1980 Republican Presidential Nomination.  In July 1974, Connally was indicted for accepting a bribe, charged with accepting $10,000 from milk producers while as Secretary of the Treasury, in return for recommending an increase in federal price supports for milk.  Tried on these charges, he was found innocent in April 1975.  After losing the 1980 presidential nomination, he dropped out of politics, and returned to work in the law firm of Vinson and Elkins.  In 1982, he went into the business of real estate development with his former political partner, Ben Barnes, but the business eventually went bankrupt.

"Burial: Texas State Cemetery Austin Travis County Texas, USA ","Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Attorney General of Texas.  JFK Assassination Figure. Born Vincent Waggoner Carr in Fairlie in Hunt County east of Dallas, his family moved to Lubbock in 1932 when the family bank in Fairlie closed. Consequently, he graduated from Lubbock High School in 1936. As a young man, he worked as a farm hand, magazine salesman and theater usher. In 1940, he completed his bachelor of business administration degree at Texas Tech University (then Texas Technological College) in Lubbock. Although he immediately began his legal studies at the University of Texas at Austin law school, he did not graduate until 1947. His studies were interrupted by the beginning of World War II in which he served for three years as an Army Air Corps pilot. He then returned home, completed his law degree and opened a private firm with his brother. In 1948, Carr was appointed assistant district attorney for the 72nd Judicial District in Lubbock. He was also the elected county attorney for Lubbock County from 1949 to 1951. He was elected to the Texas House of Representatives from Lubbock District 19 in 1950. During his ten years of service, he focused on West Texas water quality and availability. Under his leadership, the legislature proposed a constitutional amendment and passed enabling legislation to establish the Texas Water Development Board. At its creation, the board was authorized to issue up to $200 million in water development bonds for the purpose of funding local water projects. Carr also helped to establish a code of ethics for legislators and lobbyists. He promoted tourism and industrial development. He was Speaker of the house for two consecutive terms, from 1957 to 1961. Through 1958, he was the third person in Texas history to have been elected to two consecutive terms as Speaker. While in the legislature, he supported creation of the Texas Youth Council and recodification of juvenile laws, the modernization of workers' compensation statutes, reorganization of the State Insurance Board and authorization and financing of a new State Library and Archives Building in Austin, Texas. Carr was elected attorney general in 1962 and again in 1964. As attorney general, he was involved in the prosecutions of swindler Billie Sol Estes of Pecos, and Jack Ruby, or Jack Rubenstein, the Dallas nightclub owner who murdered Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged assassin of President John F. Kennedy. On the morning of November 22, 1963, Carr and his wife were among the dignitaries who ate breakfast with President and Mrs. Kennedy in Fort Worth. The president went on to Dealey Plaza in Dallas, and the Carrs flew to the Texas Panhandle for a speaking engagement. Carr learned of the tragic consequences in Dallas as his plane landed. As fate intervened, Carr participated in the investigation of the assassination. He sought to conduct a state probe, but that was blocked by the Warren Commission, which was appointed by President Johnson to determine the circumstances leading to Kennedy's death. In 1966, he ran for United States Senator, but was defeated. At the time of his loss, he had been voted the nation's best state attorney general by his peers. After leaving public office in January 1967, Carr went into private practice and eventually joined the law firm of DeLeon and Boggins in Austin. In 1968 he ran for governor in the Democratic primary in a race to succeed his friend, the retiring John Connally. He ran third in the primary, and the nomination and the election eventually went to Preston Smith. In 1971 he was indicted and tried on charges of fraud, conspiracy and filing false reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission in what was called the ""Sharpstown scandal"". Acquitted of all charges in 1974, he co-authored, with Jack Keever, a book entitled ""Waggoner Carr, Not Guilty"" (1977). He was appointed to the board of regents of Texas Tech University, serving from 1969 to 1972. He also was state commander of the American Legion. In 1989, he was selected to chair the Action for Metropolitan Government Committee in an attempt to unite the Austin municipal and Travis County governments. He was awarded a certificate of appreciation from the Austin City Council in 1991, and that same year he was appointed by the Texas Supreme Court to serve on a citizens' commission examining the Texas judicial system. He also wrote ""Texas Politics in My Rearview Mirror"", (1994) with co-author, Byron Varner. At the time of his death, he was writing books about Jesse James and the past attorneys general of Texas. Succumbing to cancer after a ten year battle, he was interred in Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

"Burial: Texas State Cemetery Austin Travis County Texas, USA ","Author. Fred Gipson was born on a farm near Mason, Texas, balancing his early life between school and working on the family farm until 1933 when he enrolled in the University of Texas. He took a keen interest in journalism, writing for both the Daily Texan and the Ranger before quitting school to work as a reporter for the Corpus Christi Caller-Times in 1937. He drifted from one newspaper job to another and began contributing stories to magazines, mostly Western pulps at first, but after awhile he started getting his articles into higher quality publications like Look and Liberty. His first novel, ""The Fabulous Empire: Colonel Zack Miller's Story"", was released in 1946 and was somewhat successful, but his follow-up ""Hound-Dog Man"" three years later sold over a quarter-million copies and was named a Book-of-the-Month Club selection. Encouraged by his first big hit, he wrote a series of novels continuing the Southwestern family theme: ""The Home Place"" (1950), ""The Trail-Driving Rooster"" (1955) and ""Recollection Creek"" (1955). However, it was his 1956 novel ""Old Yeller"" that established him as an author to be reckoned with. ""Old Yeller"", the story of a small Texas farming family and their dog, was made into a movie in 1957 by Disney and would go on to become a classic family film of the era. Gipson wrote a sequel, titled ""Savage Sam"", in 1962 and that too became a Disney film as well in 1963. He was the recipient of many writing accolades over his twenty year career, winning the first Sequoyah Book Award, among many others. After a short term serving as the president of the Texas Institute of Letters in the mid-sixties, he entered semi-retirement, marrying Angelina Torres in 1967. He died six years later at his ranch near Mason, near the spot where he was born, and by order of the governor was laid to rest in the Texas State Cemetery in recognition of his literary contributions to the state of Texas.

"Burial: Texas State Cemetery Austin Travis County Texas, USA ","Twenty-sixth Governor of Texas. Considered one of the most colorful and controversial figures in the history of Texas politics. Ferguson was born near Salado in Bell County, the son of a minister who died when James was four years old. He entered Salado College at age 12,  was soon expelled for disobedience,  and left home at 16 to drift through the western states,  working in a vineyard, a mine, a barbed wire factory and a grain ranch. Upon his return to Texas, he studied law and in 1897 was admitted to the bar. He married Miriam Amanda Wallace in 1899. Ferguson started his political career in 1903 as the City Attorney in Belton. He established Farmers State Bank, which he sold in 1906,  and then established Temple State Bank. In 1914 he ran for Texas Governor as an anti-prohibitionist Democrat, pledging to be ""Farmer Jim,"" a people's governor who would make the government work for the common man;  he was elected to two terms,  serving as Governor from January 19, 1915 to August 25, 1917.  Ferguson's time in that office was curtailed by controversy. In the middle of his second term, he vetoed appropriations for the University of Texas in retaliation for its refusal to dismiss faculty members he felt were lazy freeloaders who didn't earn their salaries. This move started a drive for impeachment proceedings against him. In July of 1917, he was indicted on nine charges. Seven of the charges related to misapplication of public funds, one to embezzlement, and one to the diversion of a special fund. He was convicted by the Senate on ten of twenty-one charges against him levied by the Texas House of Representatives. Five of the articles sustained by the Senate charged him with the misapplication of public funds, three related to his quarrel with the University; one declared that he had failed properly to respect and enforce the banking laws of the state; and one charged that he had received $156,500 in currency from a source that he refused to reveal. Ferguson resigned his office the day before the judgment was announced, but was still declared ineligible to hold office under Texas jurisdiction due to the impeachment judgment. He nevertheless ran again for Governor in 1918, to be defeated in the Democratic primary by former Lieutenant Governor William P. Hobby. In 1920, he ran for President of the United States as a candidate on the American Party ticket, but was on the ballot only in Texas;  he also failed in his bid for a seat in the United States Senate in 1922, losing in the Democratic runoff. In 1924, he entered his wife, Miriam ""Ma"" Ferguson, in the Democratic primary race for Texas Governor. Their slogan was ""Two Governors for the price of one"" and they publicized themselves with the nicknames ""Ma"" and ""Pa"" Ferguson. She won and served two non-consecutive terms. In 1935, due to financial reversals, the Fergusons lost their Texas ranch. James Ferguson died of a stroke and is buried next to ""Ma"" at Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

The bank he had started had failed due to mismanagement during his absence, and his wife's inheritance was gone, so they moved to Bosque County, Texas, almost penniless. They sold eggs and butter to attempt to make ends meet. In 1924, Jim Ferguson decided that Miriam should run for Governor under the nickname ""Ma"" so as to appeal to the average person.   She won the election and served from 1925 to 1927. The Fergusons' campaign slogan was ""Two governors for the price of one"".  Many felt she issued too many pardons and she lost her bid for re-election in 1930,  but she ran again in 1932 and won, serving from 1933 to 1935.   Ferguson continued issuing pardons; however, since it was saving the State money, her detractors were silent.  After a few years away from politics she ran for Governor again in 1940, when she was 65 years of age, but lost in the primary. She outlived her husband by 17 years and was buried next to him in the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

He subsequently studied law in New Orleans. He reached San Antonio, Texas late in 1821 after his father's death.

He expanded and wholly managed the colony, becoming the most successful of all the empresarios' as those who contracted to settle colonies were called. He was responsible for building a sound legal base for his settlement, as well as the continued introduction of slaves. At first he was loyal to Mexico and desirous of his colony remaining apart from political turmoil that was wracking the country believing Texas could become an independent state within the Mexican commonwealth. He sought to thwart the ambition of his people to annex to the United States. Against his better judgment he went to Mexico City with a petition requesting the creation of an independent state government for Texas. He was placed in jail and upon his release he returned to Texas in time to participate in the revolution. He served initially as commander of the region's volunteer army. He then journeyed to the United States to garner support for their efforts. He returned to Texas in June of 1836, after the fighting had all but ceased.

"Burial: University of Texas at Austin Austin Travis County Texas, USA ","Mascot. The idea to use a live longhorn as the university's mascot is attributed to UT alumnus Stephen Pinckney in 1916. Pinckney gathered $124 from other alumni to purchase a steer in the Texas Panhandle, which they originally named ""Bo"" and shipped to Austin. The original mascot was a pit bulldog named ""Pig"". During a halftime game, two West Texas cowboys dragged a half-starved and frightened longhorn steer onto the field, where it was formally presented to the UT student body by a group of Texas Exes. They were led by Stephen Pinckney (LL.B. 1911), who had long wanted to acquire a real longhorn as a living mascot for the University. While working for the U. S. Attorney General's office, he'd spent most of the year in West Texas assisting with raids on cattle rustlers. A raid near Laredo in late September turned up a steer whose fur was so orange Pinckney knew he'd found his mascot. With $1.00 contributions from 124 fellow alumni, Pinckney purchased the animal and arranged for its transportation to the University campus. Loaded onto a boxcar without food or water, the steer arrived at the Austin train station just in time for the football game. After presenting the longhorn to the students, the animal was removed to a South Austin stockyard for a formal photograph and a long overdue meal. In the meantime, the Texas football team ran two punts in for scores to win the game 21 - 7.  And to spread the news, the December 1916 issue of the Texas Exes Alcalde magazine was rushed into press. Editor Ben Dyer (BA 1910) gave a full account of the game and halftime proceedings. About the longhorn, Dyer stated simply, ""His name is Bevo. Long may he reign!"". With the football season over, the steer remained in South Austin while UT students discussed what to do with him. The Texan newspaper favored branding the longhorn with a large ""T"" on one side and ""21 - 7"" on the other as a permanent reminder of the Texas victory. The debate was abruptly settled early on Sunday morning, February 12, 1917. A group of four Texas A &amp; M students equipped ""with all the utensils for steer branding"" broke into the South Austin stockyard at 3:00am. There was a struggle, but the Aggies were able to brand the longhorn ""13 - 0,"" which was the score of the 1915 football game A &amp; M had won in College Station. There have been fourteen Bevos since the first one was introduced.  However, now instead of buying a longhorn they are supplied to the university by John T.
