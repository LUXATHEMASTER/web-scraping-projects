"Burial: Confederate Cemetery San Antonio Bexar County Texas, USA ","Civil War Confederate Brigadier General. One of the first general officers to be killed in the American Civil War, he is best remembered for inspiring the famous nickname ""Stonewall"" upon then Brigadier General Thomas J. Jackson at the First Battle of Bull Run (also known as First Manassas). Born in Charleston, South Carolina to a prominent family of English ancestry, he moved with his family to Pendleton, South Carolina in 1833, where he attended the Pendleton Academy. Three years later, his parents moved to Texas, but he stayed behind with his mother's sisters to pursue his education. He received an appointment to attend the US Military Academy at West Point, New York and graduated in 1845 with a commission as a 2nd lieutenant and was assigned to the 3rd US Infantry. His first assignment was serving in the military occupation of Texas. During the Mexican-American War, he was twice brevetted for gallantry, first at the Battle of Cerro Gordo near Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico, where he was wounded, and then at the Battle of Chapultepec in Mexico City. After the Mexican-American War, he was assigned to garrison duty at Pascagoula, Mississippi, where he served as adjutant, followed by frontier duty, mostly at Fort Fillmore in New Mexico Territory from 1849 to 1855. In 1855 he was promoted to the rank of captain of Company D of the Tenth Infantry and assigned to Fort Snelling, Minnesota. In 1857 his unit participated in the Utah War, where he was placed in command of the Utah Volunteer Battalion and brevetted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1860 he was posted to Fort Laramie, Wyoming, briefly serving as the fort's commanding officer. When the Southern States seceded from the Union in 1861, he resigned from the US Army and returned to Charleston where he was elected lieutenant colonel of the 1st South Carolina Regulars. On June 17, 1861 he was appointed brigadier general and given command of the 3rd Brigade of the Army of the Shenandoah, under Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, that was mobilized at Manassas Junction in Virginia. During the subsequent battle, later known as the First Battle of Bull Run, he is purported to have used the term ""stone wall"" in reference to then Brigadier General Thomas J. Jackson and his men, giving rise to the name ""Stonewall Jackson"" and his Stonewall Brigade. He was mortally wounded as the Confederates began to gain the upper hand in the battle and he died the following day at Manassas, Virginia at the age of 37. Because he died shortly after the battle, it could not be fully determined whether his naming of ""Stonewall"" Jackson was intended as praise, a condemnation, or whether it was simply a misattributed quote. His older brother, Hamilton P. Bee, was also a Confederate Army brigadier general who served in the Texas campaign.

"Burial: Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery San Antonio Bexar County Texas, USA ","Viet Nam Congressional Medal of Honor Recipient. Served in the Viet Nam War in the United States Army as a Master Sergeant, in Detachment B-56, 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), 1st Special Forces (the Green Berets). He was awarded the CMOH for his bravery West of Loc Ninh on May 2, 1968 while a Staff Sergeant. His citation reads On the morning of 2 May 1968, a 12-man Special Forces Reconnaissance Team was inserted by helicopters in a dense jungle area west of Loc Ninh, Vietnam to gather intelligence information about confirmed large-scale enemy activity. This area was controlled and routinely patrolled by the North Vietnamese Army. After a short period of time on the ground, the team met heavy enemy resistance, and requested emergency extraction. Three helicopters attempted extraction, but were unable to land due to intense enemy small arms and anti-aircraft fire. Sergeant Benavidez was at the Forward Operating Base in Loc Ninh monitoring the operation by radio when these helicopters returned to off-load wounded crewmembers and to assess aircraft damage. Sergeant Benavidez voluntarily boarded a returning aircraft to assist in another extraction attempt. Realizing that all the team members were either dead or wounded and unable to move to the pickup zone, he directed the aircraft to a nearby clearing where he jumped from the hovering helicopter, and ran approximately 75 meters under withering small arms fire to the crippled team. Prior to reaching the team's position he was wounded in his right leg, face, and head. Despite these painful injuries, he took charge, repositioning the team members and directing their fire to facilitate the landing of an extraction aircraft, and the loading of wounded and dead team members. He then threw smoke canisters to direct the aircraft to the team's position. Despite his severe wounds and under intense enemy fire, he carried and dragged half of the wounded team members to the awaiting aircraft. He then provided protective fire by running alongside the aircraft as it moved to pick up the remaining team members. As the enemy's fire intensified, he hurried to recover the body and classified documents on the dead team leader. When he reached the leader's body, Sergeant Benavidez was severely wounded by small arms fire in the abdomen and grenade fragments in his back. At nearly the same moment, the aircraft pilot was mortally wounded, and his helicopter crashed. Although in extremely critical condition due to his multiple wounds, Sergeant Benavidez secured the classified documents and made his way back to the wreckage, where he aided the wounded out of the overturned aircraft, and gathered the stunned survivors into a defensive perimeter. Under increasing enemy automatic weapons and grenade fire, he moved around the perimeter distributing water and ammunition to his weary men, reinstilling in them a will to live and fight. Facing a buildup of enemy opposition with a beleaguered team, Sergeant Benavidez mustered his strength, began calling in tactical air strikes and directed the fire from supporting gunships to suppress the enemy's fire and so permit another extraction attempt. He was wounded again in his thigh by small arms fire while administering first aid to a wounded team member just before another extraction helicopter was able to land. His indomitable spirit kept him going as he began to ferry his comrades to the craft. On his second trip with the wounded, he was clubbed from additional wounds to his head and arms before killing his adversary. He then continued under devastating fire to carry the wounded to the helicopter. Upon reaching the aircraft, he spotted and killed two enemy soldiers who were rushing the craft from an angle that prevented the aircraft door gunner from firing upon them. With little strength remaining, he made one last trip to the perimeter to ensure that all classified material had been collected or destroyed, and to bring in the remaining wounded. Only then, in extremely serious condition from numerous wounds and loss of blood, did he allow himself to be pulled into the extraction aircraft. Sergeant Benavidez's gallant choice to join voluntarily his comrades who were in critical straits, to expose himself constantly to withering enemy fire, and his refusal to be stopped despite numerous severe wounds, saved the lives of at least eight men. His fearless personal leadership, tenacious devotion to duty, and extremely valorous actions in the face of overwhelming odds were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service, and reflect the utmost credit on him and the United States Army. His Medal was issued to him at the Pentagon by President Ronald Reagan on February 24, 1981.

As a boy, he learned the art of dealing a deck of cards and became so good at it he was hired to work as a dealer in a gambling establishment. There he worked until he made his boss wealthy. With a little money he then moved to San Antonio. His luck at poker soon helped him to pay down on a home and open a saloon. As he continued to win he opened and expanded his saloon operations city-wide. He also invested in real estate and became San Antonio's greatest entrepreneur. Occasionally, he made cross country gambling trips and became one of the most feared men in the nation at the gambling tables. His gambling abilities were known from coast-to-coast.

"Burial: Confederate Cemetery San Antonio Bexar County Texas, USA GPS (lat/lon):  29.41993, -98.46339 ","Politician, Confederate Civil War Brigadier General. Born in Charleston, South Carolina to a prominent family of English ancestry, he moved with his family to Pendleton, South Carolina in 1833. In 1836, when he was 14 years old, his family moved to Texas where his father was a leader in the Texas Revolution against Mexico. At age 17, he was appointed as secretary for the commission that determined the border between the US and the Republic of Texas. In 1843, Texas President Sam Houston sent him along with Joseph C. Eldridge and Thomas S. Torrey to open negotiations with the Comanche Native American tribe and they achieved the Treaty of Tehuacana Creek. In 1846 he served as Secretary of the Texas Senate in the First Texas Legislature. After the outbreak of the Mexican-American War in 1846, he served under Benjamin McCulloch's Company A of Col. Jack Hays's 1st Regiment of Texas Mounted Volunteers for a time before transferring to Mirabeau B. Lamar's Texas cavalry company as a 2nd lieutenant. The following year he signed up for a second term, serving as a first lieutenant in Lamar's Company, which was by then a component of Colonel Peter Hansborough Bell's regiment of Texas volunteers. After the war, he moved to Laredo, Texas and in 1848 he ran and won a seat in the Texas House of Representatives for the 3rd Texas Legislature. He was repeatedly re-elected and served from 1849 through the end of the 7th Legislature, for a total of 10 years in the House of Representatives. In the 6th Legislature, he was elected Speaker of the House. After the outbreak of the American Civil War in April 1861, he was elected brigadier general of the Texas militia and appointed as a brigadier general in the Confederate Army in March 1862 and commanded the brigade that consisted of the 1st, 23rd, 26th, 35th, and 36th cavalry regiments. He was headquartered in Brownsville, Texas where he facilitated the trade of cotton for munitions through Mexico. In November 1863 he abandoned Brownsville in the face of a Union expeditionary force under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks. In early 1864 he transferred to a field command under Lieutenant General Richard Taylor in the Red River Campaign. On April 9, 1864 at the Battle of Pleasant Hill, Louisiana, he had two different horses shot out from under him during a cavalry charge, but was only slightly wounded. Later, despite intense criticism of his handling of his troops, he was given command of Brigadier General Thomas Green's division in Major General John A. Wharton's cavalry corps in February 1865. After that time he commanded an infantry brigade in General Samuel B. Maxey's division until the end of the Civil War. In 1869 he and his family left Texas and moved to Saltillo, Mexico, in self-imposed exile, before returning to San Antonio, Texas in 1874 and established a law practice. He died in San Antonio at the age of 75. His papers reside at the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas. He was the older brother of Barnard Elliott Bee, Jr., who also served as a Confederate Army brigadier general in the American Civil War, and who was killed at the First Battle of Bull Run (also known as the First Battle of Manassas) at Manassas, Virginia in July 1861.

"Burial: Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery San Antonio Bexar County Texas, USA ","United States Army Officer. He was the founder and first Commander of the United States Army's Counter-terrorist 1st Special Operations Detachment - Delta, also known as ""Delta Force"". He is remembered for its most decisive failure, the attempt to rescue the 52 hostages held in the American Embassy in Teheran, Iran in 1980.  Born in Atlanta, Georgia, affectionately known as Chargin' Charlie, was a six foot, 3 inch Green Beret (Army Special Forces) officer and decorated hero of the Vietnam War.  After attending Brown High School, he was an all-state Football player and three-year starting guard on the University of Georgia Football team.  Obtaining his Army commission in the Infantry in 1952, he was assigned to the 508th Regimental Combat Team at Fort Benning, Georgia, and later spent three years with the 82nd Airborne Division.  When the Special Forces were created in 1958, he immediately took an interest and joined them, becoming an Advisor in 1960 in South Vietnam.  In 1962, he was trained with the British Army's 22nd Special Air Service Regiment during Britain's war to put down communist guerillas in Malaysia, and much of what he learned there he would put into the later Delta Force.  He returned to Vietnam in 1965, where he fought an eight-day battle against North Vietnamese regulars at Plei Me.  Later, in 1966, he was severely wounded when an enemy .50 caliber round hit him in the stomach.  In 1974, after many years arguing for a special anti-terrorist unit, the Army selected him to form one, the result was Delta Force, which he located in an old post stockade at Fort Bragg, North Carolina so they could train in privacy.  In 1979, radicals seized the United States Embassy in Teheran, Iran, and held the American Embassy personnel there as hostages.  President Jimmy Carter then authorized Delta Force to plan and execute a rescue mission.  When the mission failed, and eight servicemen died in the evacuation of their secret desert base, Beckwith's career in the Army was effectively ended.  He retired from the Army in 1981, and formed a consulting firm, Security Assistance Services.  In 1983, he wrote a book, ""Delta Force"" with Donald Knox, in which he blamed the helicopters and their Marine Corps pilots for the failure of the rescue mission.  An innovative thinker and creative soldier, his concept of a counter-terrorist force would been seen as years ahead of its time.  He died in his home in Austin, Texas, of natural causes.

"Burial: Confederate Cemetery San Antonio Bexar County Texas, USA ","Confederate Military Officer, Texas Ranger. Born in Fort Gibson, Cherokee Nation. His father died when he was 2 and by 1845, he and his family had lived in numerous locations. As an adult, he continued this restless lifestyle, never staying in one place for very long. In 1845, he moved to Texas to live with his brother, John Robert Baylor near La Grange, in Ross Prairie. He attended Rutersville College and later attended Baylor University at Independence, Texas. He worked for a short time as a clerk with the Commissary Department of the U. S. Army at the Alamo in San Antonio. In 1854, he moved to California, sure that he would strike it rich in the gold fields. He was in San Francisco in 1856 and was a member of the Vigilance Committee. He returned to Texas about 1859. In June, 1860, he was again living with his brother, but in Weatherford. Baylor and his brother and others ran down a party of Indian raiders in Parker County and killed nine of the band. He was commissioned a first lieutenant in Company H of the Second Cavalry, John Robert Baylor's Arizona Brigade serving as regimental adjutant before he resigned to be senior aide-de-camp to General Albert Sidney Johnston in the fall of 1861. When Johnston died at the battle of Shiloh, Tennessee on April 6, 1862, Baylor returned to Texas and was elected lieutenant colonel and commander of the Second Battalion of Henry H. Sibley's army. The battalion merged with the Second Cavalry regiment of the Arizona Brigade and he was elected its colonel, and also commanded a regiment of cavalry during the Red River campaign of 1864; commended for gallantry at the battles of Mansfield and Pleasant Hill. April 6, 1865 at the Fannin Hotel in Galveston, Baylor, after an argument about ""military matters"", shot and killed a fellow staff member, John Austin Wharton an incident he regretted the rest of his life. After the Civil War, Baylor was commissioned a second lieutenant and commanded Company C, Frontier Battalion of Texas Rangers in El Paso. He and his family made a forty-two day trip to Ysleta to establish his headquarters in 1879. The remainder of that year saw him tracking down the raiding Indians in that area, specifically in the pursuit of Mescalero Apache chief Victorio; however this endeavor was ineffective. In September 1880 Baylor was transferred and promoted to captain of Company A and in 1882, promoted to major and given command of several ranger companies. During this period he was active in the fence-cutting conflict in Nolan County. He was described as being a poor disciplinarian and an indifferent judge of men; he did, however, have a flair for writing for newspapers and had a ""fair"" education. After his Company was disbanded, he resigned from ranger service in 1885 and was elected to the Texas House of Representatives from El Paso and served as clerk of the district and circuit courts for a number of years. He got along well with his Mexican neighbors, a trait not shared by all Rangers, and lived in Mexico from 1898 until 1913, returning to San Antonio where he died in 1916. He is buried in the Confederate Cemetery.

When Generalissimo Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna and his army arrived in San Antonio, Jose Maria Esparza and his family were advised to take refuge in the Alamo, since they had been friendly with the Americans. Although Alamo commander William Barret Travis, through the influence of Jim Bowie, was allowing local citizens to leave the Alamo if they so desired, he elected to stay and fight, and his family remained with him. He tended a cannon during the siege and was killed during the final assault. Francisco Esparza, a member of Santa Anna's army, requested and was granted permission to enter the Alamo and search for his brother's body. With two other brothers, he found Gregorio's body and buried it in the Campo Santo cemetery of San Fernando Cathedral. He thus became the only Alamo defender to receive a Christian burial. The bodies of the other defenders were burned. Due to a dearth of records, Gregorio's whereabouts are uncertain today. It is believed his remains could rest in an unmarked grave in San Fernando Cemetery Number One, or could rest under the Santa Rosa Medical Center which, with the present Milam Park, now occupies the site of the former Campo Santo.

His award was a result of a government review of the war records of Jewish American and Hispanic American veterans from World War II through the Vietnam War, designed to eliminate any prejudices to those who were deserving of the Medal of Honor for their heroism. He dropped out of high school in his sophomore year and joined the US Army in 1968. Following his basic training, he was sent to Vietnam where he served as a radio-telephone operator in the 101st Airborne. In 1970 he was discharged from military duty and began working as a mail carrier for the US Postal Service, retiring in 2002. He also served in the Texas National Guard from 1972 until 1989.

After breaching an insurgent perimeter, Specialist Four Erevia was designated by his platoon leader to render first aid to several casualties, and the rest of the platoon moved forward. As he was doing so, he came under intense hostile fire from four bunkers to his left front. Although he could have taken cover with the rest of the element, he chose a retaliatory course of action. With heavy enemy fire directed at him, he moved in full view of the hostile gunners as he proceeded to crawl from one wounded man to another, gathering ammunition. Armed with two M-16 rifles and several hand grenades, he charged toward the enemy positions behind the suppressive fire of the two rifles. Under very intense fire, he continued to advance on the insurgents until he was near the first bunker. Disregarding the enemy fire, he pulled the pin from a hand grenade and advanced on the bunker, leveling suppressive fire until he could drop the grenade into the bunker, mortally wounding the insurgent and destroying the fortification. Without hesitation, he employed identical tactics as he proceeded to eliminate the next two enemy positions. With the destruction of the third bunker, Specialist Four Erevia had exhausted his supply of hand grenades. Still under intense fire from the fourth position, he courageously charged forward behind the fire emitted by his M-16 rifles. Arriving at the very edge of the bunker, he silenced the occupant within the fortification at point blank range. Through his heroic actions the lives of the wounded were saved and the members of the Company Command Post were relieved from a very precarious situation. His exemplary performance in the face of overwhelming danger was an inspiration to his entire company and contributed immeasurably to the success of the mission.

"Burial: San Fernando Cathedral San Antonio Bexar County Texas, USA ","Folk Figure, Frontiersman, Soldier, US Congressman, and Defender of the Alamo. Commonly referred to as the ""King of the Wild Frontier,"" his exploits as an American folk hero were popularized in films, stage plays, and books, which were often exaggerated. Born in present-day Greene County, Tennessee near Limestone, his father struggled to make ends meet. As a young boy, he had to work to help pay his father's debts and would often tend cattle for local farmers. In 1806 he married Polly Finley and they moved several times before he signed up as a scout and forager for the local militia in September 1813 during the Creek War. The following year he participated in a military expedition in Spanish Florida and returned home in December 1814. After relocating to Lawrence County, Tennessee, he first entered politics, serving as a county commissioner and justice of the peace. In 1818 he was elected as a lieutenant colonel of the 57th Tennessee Militia and was soon engaged in several local business ventures. In 1821 he resigned as commissioner and was elected to the Tennessee Legislature and was re-elected two years later. In 1825 he ran as a National Republican and lost for a seat for Tennessee's 9th district in the US House of Representatives but won the following year, serving for two terms from March 1827 until March 1831. He voted against President Andrew Jackson's 1830 Indian Removal Act which made him unpopular with his constituents and he lost his seat in the 1830 election. In 1832 he ran for the US House of Representatives from Tennessee's newly created 12th district and was elected, defeating his former opponent William Fitzgerald, serving one term from March 1833 until March 1835. During this last term, he had expressed a desire about moving to Texas, and in November 1835, he assembled a group of volunteers and led them to the Alamo mission in present-day San Antonio, Texas where, on February 8, 1836, he joined up with the legendary James Bowie and Alamo commander Lieutenant Colonel William Barret Travis. They encountered a force of about 1,800 Mexican soldiers under the command of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. With only about 185 to 260 men, the Alamo defenders managed to hold off the Mexican Army for 13 days until they were finally overrun on March 6, 1836 and Crockett died either in combat or was executed at the age of 49. Historians disagree on how he died, as there are several accounts of his death that cannot be accurately verified. Over the years, his character has been portrayed in numerous films and television programs, including Jack Perrin in ""The Painted Stallion"" (1937), Robert Barrat in ""Man of Conquest"" (1939), Arthur Hunnicutt in ""The Last Command"" (1955), Fess Parker in ""Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier"" (1955) and ""Davy Crockett and the River Pirates"" (1956), John Wayne in ""The Alamo"" (1960), Brian Keith in ""The Alamo: 13 Days to Glory"" (1987), Johnny Cash in ""Davy Crockett: Rainbow in the Thunder"" (1988), John Schneider in James A. Michener's ABC television miniseries ""Texas"" (1994), and Billy Bob Thornton in ""The Alamo"" (2004). The song ""The Ballad of Davy Crockett"" sung by Bill Hayes and written for the ABC television miniseries ""Davy Crockett"" that aired from 1954 to 1955, reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts from March to April 1955. In addition to his burial location at the San Fernando Cathedral in San Antonio, Texas, a cenotaph resides at his birthplace in Limestone Springs, Tennessee.

"Burial: Mission Burial Park South San Antonio Bexar County Texas, USA ","Texas Oil Pioneer. He was known as, The prophet of Spindletop."" As a young man, he was often in trouble and wounds from one fight even caused him to lose his left arm. In 1886, he started a company in Beaumont, Texas that made bricks. He learned how some industries were using oil rather than wood as fuel and thought he might be able to use oil to make bricks less expensively. In 1892, he and partners formed the Gladys City Oil, Gas and Manufacturing Company to explore for oil at Spindletop near Beaumont. On January 10, 1901, his crew struck oil and for the next nine days pumped 900,000 barrels resulting in 200 more wells being drilled within a year. After legal and royalty suits were settled in 1902, he sold his shares for $3 million, but shrewdly retained his leasing rights on his original acreage. His next venture was to form the Higgins Standard Oil Company, which became the vehicle for subsequent explorations of Texas Gulf Coast salt-dome fields. Over the next fifty years, he continued to be a maverick in the oil and gas industry. One day he would be a millionaire and the next he would be fighting with investors for more money to continue drilling. In addition to being a self-taught geologist, he was also a draftsman, cartographer, inventor, naturalist, industrial designer, artist, engineer and a very religious man.

Born in Logan County (present day Simpson County), Kentucky, one of ten children of Rezin and Elve Bowie. About 1809 the Bowies moved to Louisiana where they established a plantation on the Vermilion River. During the War of 1812, Bowie and his brother joined the Louisiana militia, but saw little action. After the war the brothers traded illegally in slaves and also dabbled in land speculation. In 1827, Bowie was embroiled in the so called Sandbar Fight which marked his first notable use of the heavy bladed knife that would be named for him; he gained a reputation as a formidable knife fighter. In 1829, Bowie became engaged to Cecelia Wells but she died two weeks before their wedding was to take place. By February 1830, Bowie was in Texas and took the oath of allegiance to Mexico. On April 25, 1831, Bowie married Ursula de Veramendi in San Antonio; a little more than two years later, Ursula, her parents, and her child died in a cholera epidemic and Bowie reportedly turned to the bottle. In 1835 Bowie was appointed a commissioner to promote settlement in Texas, but fled when Santa Ana abolished the Coahuila-Texas government and ordered the arrest of all Texans. Bowie joined with the so called Texas War Party; in October, Bowie with ninety-two men faced off with the Mexicans, who had three times the troops, in a battle that lasted three hours. Bowie captured a six-pounder cannon and thirty muskets and lost one man. The Mexicans suffered over thirty casualties. In November he asked to be relieved of his command. On January 19, 1836, Bowie arrived in Bexar with thirty men carrying orders from Sam Houston for the demolition of the fortifications there. On February 2, Bowie wrote the Governor, urging that Bexar be held. William Travis arrived with thirty men on February 3 in order to take command of the forces quartered at the Alamo mission near Bexar. Bowie and Travis then worked out a compromise which gave Travis command of the regulars, Bowie command of the volunteers. On February 24 Bowie collapsed and took to his bed. Speculation on his ailment favors typhoid pneumonia or tuberculosis. On March 6 the Mexican forces attacked, and all the defenders of the Alamo died; Bowie was found on his cot in a room on the south side. He had been shot several times.

Official CMOH citation: For valorous and gallant conduct above and beyond the call of duty as a member of an assault engineer platoon of the 1st Battalion, 18th Marines, tactically attached to the 2d Marine Division, in action against the Japanese-held atoll of Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands on 20 November 1943. Landing in the assault waves under withering enemy fire which killed all but 4 of the men in his tractor, S/Sgt. Bordelon hurriedly made demolition charges and personally put 2 pillboxes out of action. Hit by enemy machinegun fire just as a charge exploded in his hand while assaulting a third position, he courageously remained in action and, although out of demolition, provided himself with a rifle and furnished fire coverage for a group of men scaling the seawall. Disregarding his own serious condition, he unhesitatingly went to the aid of one of his demolition men, wounded and calling for help in the water, rescuing this man and another who had been hit by enemy fire while attempting to make the rescue. Still refusing first aid for himself, he again made up demolition charges and single-handedly assaulted a fourth Japanese machinegun position but was instantly killed when caught in a final burst of fire from the enemy.

At the time of his death he was the oldest living Hispanic recipient of the CMOH and was one of fewer than 40 surviving World War II veterans with the honor. He served in the United States Army during World War II as a Sergeant in the 23rd Infantry, 2nd Infantry Division. He was awarded the CMOH for his bravery near Krinkelt, Belgium on December 17, 1944. His citation reads On his own initiative, he carried his heavy machinegun from Company K's right flank to its left, in order to protect that flank which was in danger of being overrun by advancing enemy infantry supported by tanks. Occupying a shallow hole offering no protection above his waist, he cut down a group of 10 Germans. Ignoring enemy fire from an advancing tank, he held his position and cut down 25 more enemy infantry attempting to turn his flank. Glancing to his right, he saw a large number of infantry swarming in from the front. Although dazed and shaken from enemy artillery fire which had crashed into the ground only a few yards away, he realized that his position soon would be outflanked. Again, alone, he carried his machinegun to a position to the right rear of the sector; enemy tanks and infantry were forcing a withdrawal. Blown over backward by the concussion of enemy fire, he immediately reset his gun and continued his fire. Single-handed he held off the German horde until he was satisfied his company had effected its retirement. Again he loaded his gun on his back and in a hail of small arms fire he ran to a point where a few of his comrades were attempting to set up another defense against the onrushing enemy. He fired from this position until his ammunition was exhausted. Still carrying his gun, he fell back with his small group to Krinkelt. Sgt. Lopez's gallantry and intrepidity, on seemingly suicidal missions in which he killed at least 100 of the enemy, were almost solely responsible for allowing Company K to avoid being enveloped, to withdraw successfully and to give other forces coming up in support time to build a line which repelled the enemy drive.

His citation reads For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. Pfc. Lee distinguished himself near the city of Phu Bai in the province of Thua Thien. Pfc. Lee was serving as the radio telephone operator with the 3d platoon,Company B. As lead element for the company, the 3d platoon received intense surprise hostile fire from a force of North Vietnamese Army regulars in well-concealed bunkers. With 50 percent casualties, the platoon maneuvered to a position of cover to treat their wounded and reorganize, while Pfc. Lee moved through the heavy enemy fire giving life saving first aid to his wounded comrades. During the subsequent assault on the enemy defensive positions, Pfc. Lee continuously kept close radio contact with the company commander, relaying precise and understandable orders to his platoon leader. While advancing with the front rank toward the objective, Pfc. Lee observed 4 North Vietnamese soldiers with automatic weapons and a rocket launcher lying in wait for the lead element of the platoon. As the element moved forward, unaware of the concealed danger, Pfc. Lee immediately and with utter disregard for his own personal safety, passed his radio to another soldier and charged through the murderous fire. Without hesitation he continued his assault, overrunning the enemy position, killing all occupants and capturing 4 automatic weapons and a rocket launcher. Pfc. Lee continued his 1-man assault on the second position through a heavy barrage of enemy automatic weapons fire. Grievously wounded, he continued to press the attack, crawling forward into a firing position and delivering accurate covering fire to enable his platoon to maneuver and destroy the position. Not until the position was overrun did Pfc. Lee falter in his steady volume of fire and succumb to his wounds. Pfc. Lee's heroic actions saved the lives of the lead element and were instrumental in the destruction of the key position of the enemy defense. Pfc. Lee's gallantry at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit on himself, the 502nd Infantry, and the U.S. Army.

"Burial: Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery San Antonio Bexar County Texas, USA ","World War II Congressional Medal of Honor Recipient. He served in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II as a 2nd Lieutenant Rank in the 564th Bomber Squadron, 389th Bomber Group, 9th Air Force. He was awarded the CMOH for his bravery during the raid on Ploesti, Romania, on August 1, 1943. His citation reads ""For conspicuous gallantry in action and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. On August 1943, 2d Lt. Hughes served in the capacity of pilot of a heavy bombardment aircraft participating in a long and hazardous minimum-altitude attack against the Axis oil refineries of Ploesti, Rumania, launched from the northern shores of Africa. Flying in the last formation to attack the target, he arrived in the target area after previous flights had thoroughly alerted the enemy defenses. Approaching the target through intense and accurate antiaircraft fire and dense balloon barrages at dangerously low altitude, his plane received several direct hits from both large and small caliber antiaircraft guns which seriously damaged his aircraft, causing sheets of escaping gasoline to stream from the bomb bay and from the left wing. This damage was inflicted at a time prior to reaching the target when 2d Lt. Hughes could have made a forced landing in any of the grain fields readily available at that time. The target area was blazing with burning oil tanks and damaged refinery installations from which flames leaped high above the bombing level of the formation. With full knowledge of the consequences of entering this blazing inferno when his airplane was profusely leaking gasoline in two separate locations, 2d Lt. Hughes, motivated only by his high conception of duty which called for the destruction of his assigned target at any cost, did not elect to make a forced landing or turn back from the attack. Instead, rather than jeopardize the formation and the success of the attack, he unhesitatingly entered the blazing area and dropped his bomb load with great precision. After successfully bombing the objective, his aircraft emerged from the conflagration with the left wing aflame. Only then did he attempt a forced landing, but because of the advanced stage of the fire enveloping his aircraft the plane crashed and was consumed. By 2d Lt. Hughes' heroic decision to complete his mission regardless of the consequences in utter disregard of his own life, and by his gallant and valorous execution of this decision, he has rendered a service to our country in the defeat of our enemies which will everlastingly be outstanding in the annals of our Nation's history"". His Medal was posthumously awarded to him on February 26, 1944.

"Burial: Milam Park San Antonio Bexar County Texas, USA ","Soldier, colonizer and entrepreneur. As a member of the Kentucky militia, he fought for several months in the War of 1812. After moving to Texas in 1818, he engaged in trade with the Comanche Native Americans. In 1819, he began involvement in activities to help Mexico and Texas gain independence from Spain. He subsequently gained Mexican citizenship and became a colonel in the Mexican army in 1824. After Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna overthrew the representative government of Mexico and established a dictatorship, Milam joined the Texas independence movement. He helped capture Goliad, and then marched with forces joining the main army to capture San Antonio. While returning from a scouting mission in the Southwest on December 4, 1835, Milam learned that a majority of the army had decided not to attack San Antonio as planned, but to go into winter quarters. Convinced that this decision would be a disaster for the cause of independence, Milam then made his famous impassioned plea: ""Who will go with old Ben Milam into San Antonio?"" Three hundred volunteered and the attack, which began at dawn on December 5, ended on December 9 with the surrender of General Martin Perfecto de Cos and the Mexican army there. During the siege, Milam was shot in the head by a sniper and died instantly.

"Burial: San Juan Cemetery San Antonio Bexar County Texas, USA ","Singer, Songwriter. He was an American singer-songwriter of Tejano and country music. He is the winner of one Grammy Award and one Latin Grammy Award. Known to most by the mononym Emilio, he charted more than ten singles on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks charts, in addition to six singles on the Billboard Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks charts. Emilio was also one of the few Tejano artists to have significant success in both the United States and Mexico, and was called the ""Garth Brooks of Tejano"". His biggest country hit was the No. 27 ""It's Not the End of the World"" in late 1995, and his highest-charting single on any chart is ""Por Siempre Unidos,"" which peaked at No. 7 on Latin Pop Airplay in 1996. Along with Selena, Emilio was one of the most prominent artists that helped popularize Tejano music. In 1983 at age 21, Emilio began his performing career by singing lead vocals for David Lee Garza y Los Musicales. In 1987, Cuantas Veces by David Lee Garza Y Los Musicales beat out Alpha by Mexican American singer Selena for Album of the Year at the Tejano Music Awards. In 1989, Navaira formed his own band, Emilio y Grupo Rio. That same year Emilio signed with Columbia Records (then known as CBS Records). This relationship resulted in Emilio recording more than fifteen studio albums to date, including several with his Rio Band. By the mid 1990s, Emilio began crediting himself solely as Emilio, eventually switching his focus to country music. Between 1989 and 1996, Emilio had released seven Spanish albums with cumulative sales of about 2 million. This success lead to mainstream commercial exposure, with companies such as Coca-Cola and Wrangler Jeans using his songs in their advertisements in the 1990s. Emilio had also gained a sponsorship with Miller Lite beer, who had persuaded him to use their slogan at the time, ""Life is good,"" as the title of his first country album. Emilio signed with Capitol Records and released his first country music single called ""It's Not the End of the World"" which reached the Top 30 on the country charts in 1995. His album was a surprise success as well reaching No. 13 on the country charts and also a high placing on the Top 200. Several more singles including a Spanish version of ""It's Not the End of the World"" followed but none of these singles came close to the Top 40 except ""Even If I Tried"" which reached No. 41 in 1996. In 1997, he released a second country album, ""It's On The House"" but it was not as successful as his first country album. Two more minor country singles followed and gradually Emilio faded from country music and increasingly came back to Tejano music. His 2002 album Acurdate won the Grammy Award for Best Tejano Album and his 2007 album De Nuevo won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Tejano Album.

"Burial: Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery San Antonio Bexar County Texas, USA ","American Actor. Known for character roles in Westerns, particularly in the films of John Ford. Although his screen credits and many records indicate a wide variety of names and spellings, Steele's own signatures on his military documents indicate that he was born William Anton Gittinger on March 28, 1888 (not 1889, as some sources have it) in San Antonio, Texas. Little is known of his life prior to his arrival in Los Angeles around 1910. As the film industry in Hollywood was just blossoming, and as he apparently had great experience with horses, Steele easily obtained work in quickie Westerns. He fought in Europe in World War I, then returned to Hollywood. While he was extremely inconsistent in the names he used, he worked consistently in Westerns throughout the silent era and up until the 1950s.

"Burial: San Fernando Cemetery #2 San Antonio Bexar County Texas, USA ","Sculptor.  He perfected a secret process in which he carved chemically treated reinforced concrete so that it looked like wood. Because he traveled throughout the United States to work on commissions and did not speak English, very little is known about him. The son of Catarina Rodrguez, he was born in Toluca, capital of the state of Mxico, in 1891 or 1893.  As a boy, he developed skills he later used in his art by working in a foundry and for an Italian artist who produced imitation rocks. He reproduced ruins of ancient buildings in collaboration with Mexican architects and engineers such as those at Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City. He came to the United States in the 1920s and moved to San Antonio, Texas.  The largest examples of his work are located in San Antonio.  He produced several major works in San Antonio's Brackenridge Park, notably the concrete footbridge that simulates an arbor of woven wooden limbs. During the 1930s he sculpted pieces for three parks in Little Rock, Arkansas. He worked with an architect to design a site to look like an abandoned mill in which everything but the stone walls of the mill was molded from cement. This mill appears in the early opening credits of the film ""Gone With The Wind."" In the mid 1930s he completed a dozen works based on literary and Biblical themes in Memorial Park Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee. The centerpiece of the cemetery is a massive grotto, the inside of which is studded with crystals. Other examples of his work have been found in Chattanooga, Tennessee; Hot Springs, Arkansas; Suitland, Maryland; Ann Arbor, Michigan; New York City; and Clayton, New Mexico. His inclusion of such painstaking details as insect holes, peeling bark, and broken-off branches in his work, which he called el trabajo rstico, demonstrates a highly refined aesthetic as well as technical mastery of his medium. He sculpted the moistened cement with his hands or simple tools such as a fork, knife, spoon, or twig. He stained the cement while it was still wet, using chemicals such as copperas, sulfuric acid, muriatic acid, iron oxide, saltpeter, and lampblack for various tints. He jealously guarded his special techniques, particularly those relating to the tinting process. He had no immediate survivors at his death.  Several of his surviving sculptures are on the National Register of Historic Places.

Rodriguez, United States Army, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action above and beyond the call of duty on 9 February 1945, while serving with Company B, 148th Infantry Regiment, 37th Infantry Division. Technical Sergeant Rodriguez was an automatic rifleman when his unit attacked the strongly defended Paco Railroad Station during the battle for Manila, Philippine Islands. While making a frontal assault across an open field, his platoon was halted 100 yards from the station by intense enemy fire. On his own initiative, he left the platoon, accompanied by a comrade, and continued forward to a house 60 yards from the objective. Although under constant enemy observation, the two men remained in this position for an hour, firing at targets of opportunity, killing more than 35 hostile soldiers and wounding many more. Moving closer to the station and discovering a group of Japanese replacements attempting to reach pillboxes, they opened heavy fire, killed more than 40 and stopped all subsequent attempts to man the emplacements. Enemy fire became more intense as they advanced to within 20 yards of the station. Then, covered by his companion, Private Rodriguez boldly moved up to the building and threw five grenades through a doorway killing 7 Japanese, destroying a 20-mm gun and wrecking a heavy machinegun. With their ammunition running low, the two men started to return to the American lines, alternately providing covering fire for each other's withdrawal. During this movement, Private Rodriguez' companion was killed. In 2 1/2 hours of fierce fighting the intrepid team killed more than 82 Japanese, completely disorganized their defense, and paved the way for the subsequent overwhelming defeat of the enemy at this strongpoint. Two days later, Private Rodriguez again enabled his comrades to advance when he single-handedly killed six Japanese and destroyed a well-placed 20-mm gun by his outstanding skill with his weapons, gallant determination to destroy the enemy, and heroic courage in the face of tremendous odds, Private Rodriguez, on two occasions, materially aided the advance of our troops in Manila.""

Travis then became an attorney in Claiborne and 1829 began publication of a newspaper, the ""Claiborne Herald"". He became a Mason, joining the Alabama Lodge No.3 - Free and Accepted Masons, and later joined the Alabama militia as adjutant of the Twenty-sixth Regiment, Eighth Brigade, Fourth Division. Because of a failed marriage, he fled Alabama in early 1831 to start over in Texas. In May 1831, upon his arrival in Mexican Texas, a part of Northern Mexico at the time, he purchased land from Stephen F. Austin and started a law practice in Anahuac. He played a role in the growing friction between American settlers and the Mexican government and was one of the leaders of the ""War Party,"" a group of militants opposed to Mexican rule. He became a pivotal figure in the Anahuac Disturbances, which helped to precipitate the war. After the start of the Texas Revolution in October, 1835, Travis took a small part in the Seige of Bexar in November. On December 19, 1835, he was commissioned lieutenant colonel in the Legion of Cavalry and was chief recruiting officer for the Texas Army. He had a hard time finding willing colonists to enlist. Acting governor, Henry Smith ordered Travis to raise a company to reinforce the Texas Army at The Alamo Mission in San Antonio. He arrived on February 3 with eighteen men, and on February 12 became the official commander of the Alamo garrison. He shared his command with Jim Bowie, who was in charge of the volunteers while Travis was in charge of the regulars.

The Mexicans overran the fort, surrounded it, used ladders to climb over the walls and broke down the fort's defenses. Legend has it that within a few hours of the final gunshots being fired, Santa Anna ordered a company of dragoons to gather wood and burn all the bodies of the defenders. By five o'clock that evening, the bodies of Travis, Crockett, Bowie and Bonham were burned along with the other defenders. Travis was only twenty-six years of age at the time of his death.
