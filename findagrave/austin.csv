Last survivor of the car that carried President  John Fitzgerald Kennedy . On November 22, 1963, it was Mrs. Connally that uttered the last words the president heard, ""Mr. President, you can't say Dallas doesn't love you,"" moments later those fateful shots rang out.  Nellie Connally was born Idanell Brill in Austin, Texas  one of five children born to Katie and Arno Brill.  She had always aspired to be an actress.  She even auditioned for the role of 'Scarlet O'Hara' in ""Gone With the Wind.""   In 1939 while at college she met her future husband John Connally.  By the time the two married a year later her acting career took a backseat.  She would be busy raising the couples for children and helping her husband with his political aspirations.  She would do everything she could from raising money to answering phones.  Her husband's mentor was future U.S. president Lyndon Johnson.  The Johnson's and the Connally's would remain forever friends, even though Nellie learned he was a man that could not be crossed.  Once when answering phones for him she accidentally disconnected a line and Lyndon Johnson threw a book in her direction.  She knew not to mess with him. Lady Bird Johnson However became a lifelong friend and someone she admired very much.  Nellie was a vivacious lady full of spunk with a great sense of humor.  She was a great asset to her husband's campaign.  In 1961 President Kennedy In 1961, President John F. Kennedy named John Connally Secretary of the Navy.  He did not stay at his job instead he ran for Governor of the state of Texas.  In 1963 he was elected Governor.  It was in November when the President decided to stop campaigning.  A tour of Texas was part of the tour.  John Connally told his wife that if only the people can see him they would surely elect him once again.  The Connally would accompany the Kennedy's on their tour.  On November 21 they went from Austin to San Antonio.  November 22, 1963 they went to Fort Worth and on to Dallas.  Everywhere they went Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Connally received a bouquet of roses.  Later on she thought it was funny they had always received yellow or white, but on that day it was red.  The motorcade was on that warm morning, and by days end the President was dead and the Governor was seriously wounded.  After the second bullet hit her husband Nellie just stayed patiently holding the hole in his chest assuring him things would be just fine.  She knew the President was already dead, and stayed focused on her husband.  At the Hospital Jackie Kennedy and Nellie Connally sat next to each other silently waiting to hear the news of their husband's fate.  An attended came up to Nellie and told her they could not operate on her husband until she filled out paperwork.  Years later Nellie would recall that if she had a gun she would have used it.  She was put in a separate room to wait for word of her husband.  The only visit she got was from Lady Bird Johnson with her arms stretched out ready to comfort her.  She would learn her husband survived.  She did not attend the funeral for the President, instead she sent her son John with a note for Mrs. Kennedy.  Jackie Kennedy told her son that if anything good came out of this it was that his father had lived.  The two never spoke again.  Nellie Connally felt it was not fair that her John lived and Jackie's did not.  John Connally would go on to be Secretary of the treasury under Nixon, but his career ended when he was accused of taking a bribe.  Nellie would face a battle with breast cancer that she would win.  She would continue her volunteer work for charitable causes.  In 1993 John Connally died.  In 1994  Jacqueline Kennedy  passed away at age 64 of cancer.

She would tell everyone she met,"" You can argue with the experts and the Warren commission, but you cannot argue with me, I was in the car.

"Burial: Texas State Cemetery Austin Travis County Texas, USA ","Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Attorney General of Texas.  JFK Assassination Figure. Born Vincent Waggoner Carr in Fairlie in Hunt County east of Dallas, his family moved to Lubbock in 1932 when the family bank in Fairlie closed. Consequently, he graduated from Lubbock High School in 1936. As a young man, he worked as a farm hand, magazine salesman and theater usher. In 1940, he completed his bachelor of business administration degree at Texas Tech University (then Texas Technological College) in Lubbock. Although he immediately began his legal studies at the University of Texas at Austin law school, he did not graduate until 1947. His studies were interrupted by the beginning of World War II in which he served for three years as an Army Air Corps pilot. He then returned home, completed his law degree and opened a private firm with his brother. In 1948, Carr was appointed assistant district attorney for the 72nd Judicial District in Lubbock. He was also the elected county attorney for Lubbock County from 1949 to 1951. He was elected to the Texas House of Representatives from Lubbock District 19 in 1950. During his ten years of service, he focused on West Texas water quality and availability. Under his leadership, the legislature proposed a constitutional amendment and passed enabling legislation to establish the Texas Water Development Board. At its creation, the board was authorized to issue up to $200 million in water development bonds for the purpose of funding local water projects. Carr also helped to establish a code of ethics for legislators and lobbyists. He promoted tourism and industrial development. He was Speaker of the house for two consecutive terms, from 1957 to 1961. Through 1958, he was the third person in Texas history to have been elected to two consecutive terms as Speaker. While in the legislature, he supported creation of the Texas Youth Council and recodification of juvenile laws, the modernization of workers' compensation statutes, reorganization of the State Insurance Board and authorization and financing of a new State Library and Archives Building in Austin, Texas. Carr was elected attorney general in 1962 and again in 1964. As attorney general, he was involved in the prosecutions of swindler Billie Sol Estes of Pecos, and Jack Ruby, or Jack Rubenstein, the Dallas nightclub owner who murdered Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged assassin of President John F. Kennedy. On the morning of November 22, 1963, Carr and his wife were among the dignitaries who ate breakfast with President and Mrs. Kennedy in Fort Worth. The president went on to Dealey Plaza in Dallas, and the Carrs flew to the Texas Panhandle for a speaking engagement. Carr learned of the tragic consequences in Dallas as his plane landed. As fate intervened, Carr participated in the investigation of the assassination. He sought to conduct a state probe, but that was blocked by the Warren Commission, which was appointed by President Johnson to determine the circumstances leading to Kennedy's death. In 1966, he ran for United States Senator, but was defeated. At the time of his loss, he had been voted the nation's best state attorney general by his peers. After leaving public office in January 1967, Carr went into private practice and eventually joined the law firm of DeLeon and Boggins in Austin. In 1968 he ran for governor in the Democratic primary in a race to succeed his friend, the retiring John Connally. He ran third in the primary, and the nomination and the election eventually went to Preston Smith. In 1971 he was indicted and tried on charges of fraud, conspiracy and filing false reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission in what was called the ""Sharpstown scandal"". Acquitted of all charges in 1974, he co-authored, with Jack Keever, a book entitled ""Waggoner Carr, Not Guilty"" (1977). He was appointed to the board of regents of Texas Tech University, serving from 1969 to 1972. He also was state commander of the American Legion. In 1989, he was selected to chair the Action for Metropolitan Government Committee in an attempt to unite the Austin municipal and Travis County governments. He was awarded a certificate of appreciation from the Austin City Council in 1991, and that same year he was appointed by the Texas Supreme Court to serve on a citizens' commission examining the Texas judicial system. He also wrote ""Texas Politics in My Rearview Mirror"", (1994) with co-author, Byron Varner. At the time of his death, he was writing books about Jesse James and the past attorneys general of Texas. Succumbing to cancer after a ten year battle, he was interred in Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

"Burial: University of Texas at Austin Austin Travis County Texas, USA ","Mascot. The idea to use a live longhorn as the university's mascot is attributed to UT alumnus Stephen Pinckney in 1916. Pinckney gathered $124 from other alumni to purchase a steer in the Texas Panhandle, which they originally named ""Bo"" and shipped to Austin. The original mascot was a pit bulldog named ""Pig"". During a halftime game, two West Texas cowboys dragged a half-starved and frightened longhorn steer onto the field, where it was formally presented to the UT student body by a group of Texas Exes. They were led by Stephen Pinckney (LL.B. 1911), who had long wanted to acquire a real longhorn as a living mascot for the University. While working for the U. S. Attorney General's office, he'd spent most of the year in West Texas assisting with raids on cattle rustlers. A raid near Laredo in late September turned up a steer whose fur was so orange Pinckney knew he'd found his mascot. With $1.00 contributions from 124 fellow alumni, Pinckney purchased the animal and arranged for its transportation to the University campus. Loaded onto a boxcar without food or water, the steer arrived at the Austin train station just in time for the football game. After presenting the longhorn to the students, the animal was removed to a South Austin stockyard for a formal photograph and a long overdue meal. In the meantime, the Texas football team ran two punts in for scores to win the game 21 - 7.  And to spread the news, the December 1916 issue of the Texas Exes Alcalde magazine was rushed into press. Editor Ben Dyer (BA 1910) gave a full account of the game and halftime proceedings. About the longhorn, Dyer stated simply, ""His name is Bevo. Long may he reign!"". With the football season over, the steer remained in South Austin while UT students discussed what to do with him. The Texan newspaper favored branding the longhorn with a large ""T"" on one side and ""21 - 7"" on the other as a permanent reminder of the Texas victory. The debate was abruptly settled early on Sunday morning, February 12, 1917. A group of four Texas A &amp; M students equipped ""with all the utensils for steer branding"" broke into the South Austin stockyard at 3:00am. There was a struggle, but the Aggies were able to brand the longhorn ""13 - 0,"" which was the score of the 1915 football game A &amp; M had won in College Station. There have been fourteen Bevos since the first one was introduced.  However, now instead of buying a longhorn they are supplied to the university by John T. Baker, owner of the Sunrise Ranch in Liberty Hill, Texas.

When he was seven years old the family moved from his father's lead mines in Virginia to southeastern Missouri. He was educated in Connecticut and at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. After returning to Missouri he gradually assumed management of his father's lead business while holding military and public positions in Missouri and Arkansas. He subsequently studied law in New Orleans. He reached San Antonio, Texas late in 1821 after his father's death. His father had been given 200,000 acres and Stephen was among the first to colonize the Spanish grant. He expanded and wholly managed the colony, becoming the most successful of all the empresarios' as those who contracted to settle colonies were called. He was responsible for building a sound legal base for his settlement, as well as the continued introduction of slaves. At first he was loyal to Mexico and desirous of his colony remaining apart from political turmoil that was wracking the country believing Texas could become an independent state within the Mexican commonwealth. He sought to thwart the ambition of his people to annex to the United States. Against his better judgment he went to Mexico City with a petition requesting the creation of an independent state government for Texas. He was placed in jail and upon his release he returned to Texas in time to participate in the revolution. He served initially as commander of the region's volunteer army. He then journeyed to the United States to garner support for their efforts. He returned to Texas in June of 1836, after the fighting had all but ceased. He was defeated by Sam Houston for election as the president of the new republic. Houston appointed him to be Secretary of State, but he would only serve for two months before he died. The original capital of Texas was known as Columbia, now West Columbia, and it was there that Austin caught a severe cold and died from pneumonia. Upon hearing of Austin's death, Houston ordered an official statement proclaiming: ""The Father of Texas is no more; the first pioneer of the wilderness has departed."" His body was taken by wagon from Columbia and was put on a boat on the Brazos River and taken to the Gulf Prairie Cemetery in Jones Creek, Texas. In 1910 his remains were removed and taken to the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

Fred Gipson was born on a farm near Mason, Texas, balancing his early life between school and working on the family farm until 1933 when he enrolled in the University of Texas. He took a keen interest in journalism, writing for both the Daily Texan and the Ranger before quitting school to work as a reporter for the Corpus Christi Caller-Times in 1937. He drifted from one newspaper job to another and began contributing stories to magazines, mostly Western pulps at first, but after awhile he started getting his articles into higher quality publications like Look and Liberty. His first novel, ""The Fabulous Empire: Colonel Zack Miller's Story"", was released in 1946 and was somewhat successful, but his follow-up ""Hound-Dog Man"" three years later sold over a quarter-million copies and was named a Book-of-the-Month Club selection. Encouraged by his first big hit, he wrote a series of novels continuing the Southwestern family theme: ""The Home Place"" (1950), ""The Trail-Driving Rooster"" (1955) and ""Recollection Creek"" (1955). However, it was his 1956 novel ""Old Yeller"" that established him as an author to be reckoned with. ""Old Yeller"", the story of a small Texas farming family and their dog, was made into a movie in 1957 by Disney and would go on to become a classic family film of the era. Gipson wrote a sequel, titled ""Savage Sam"", in 1962 and that too became a Disney film as well in 1963. He was the recipient of many writing accolades over his twenty year career, winning the first Sequoyah Book Award, among many others. After a short term serving as the president of the Texas Institute of Letters in the mid-sixties, he entered semi-retirement, marrying Angelina Torres in 1967.

"Burial: Texas State Cemetery Austin Travis County Texas, USA ","Twenty-sixth Governor of Texas. Considered one of the most colorful and controversial figures in the history of Texas politics. Ferguson was born near Salado in Bell County, the son of a minister who died when James was four years old. He entered Salado College at age 12,  was soon expelled for disobedience,  and left home at 16 to drift through the western states,  working in a vineyard, a mine, a barbed wire factory and a grain ranch. Upon his return to Texas, he studied law and in 1897 was admitted to the bar. He married Miriam Amanda Wallace in 1899. Ferguson started his political career in 1903 as the City Attorney in Belton. He established Farmers State Bank, which he sold in 1906,  and then established Temple State Bank. In 1914 he ran for Texas Governor as an anti-prohibitionist Democrat, pledging to be ""Farmer Jim,"" a people's governor who would make the government work for the common man;  he was elected to two terms,  serving as Governor from January 19, 1915 to August 25, 1917.  Ferguson's time in that office was curtailed by controversy. In the middle of his second term, he vetoed appropriations for the University of Texas in retaliation for its refusal to dismiss faculty members he felt were lazy freeloaders who didn't earn their salaries. This move started a drive for impeachment proceedings against him. In July of 1917, he was indicted on nine charges. Seven of the charges related to misapplication of public funds, one to embezzlement, and one to the diversion of a special fund. He was convicted by the Senate on ten of twenty-one charges against him levied by the Texas House of Representatives. Five of the articles sustained by the Senate charged him with the misapplication of public funds, three related to his quarrel with the University; one declared that he had failed properly to respect and enforce the banking laws of the state; and one charged that he had received $156,500 in currency from a source that he refused to reveal. Ferguson resigned his office the day before the judgment was announced, but was still declared ineligible to hold office under Texas jurisdiction due to the impeachment judgment. He nevertheless ran again for Governor in 1918, to be defeated in the Democratic primary by former Lieutenant Governor William P. Hobby. In 1920, he ran for President of the United States as a candidate on the American Party ticket, but was on the ballot only in Texas;  he also failed in his bid for a seat in the United States Senate in 1922, losing in the Democratic runoff. In 1924, he entered his wife, Miriam ""Ma"" Ferguson, in the Democratic primary race for Texas Governor. Their slogan was ""Two Governors for the price of one"" and they publicized themselves with the nicknames ""Ma"" and ""Pa"" Ferguson. She won and served two non-consecutive terms. In 1935, due to financial reversals, the Fergusons lost their Texas ranch. James Ferguson died of a stroke and is buried next to ""Ma"" at Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

He was named judge of the district in 1856, married Anne Britton in April 1858 and served as a state judge until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861; when he refused to swear allegiance to the Confederacy, he was removed from office. Because of his stand with the Union, he was forced to flee the state in May 1862 and made his way through New Orleans to Washington DC where he personally appealed to Abraham Lincoln to provide arms and troops to recapture Texas. Not only was he successful, but he received the position and rank of colonel and commander of the new First Texas Cavalry unit. He led his men through many battles: the fight at Galveston in January, 1863, where his unit barely escaped; his capture by the Confederates in Matamoros until the Mexican government intervened; fighting alongside General Nathaniel Banks during the Rio Grande campaign.

"Burial: Texas State Cemetery Austin Travis County Texas, USA ","US Congressman,  Texas Patriot.  An important political figure of the Republic and early statehood of Texas.  He was the first person to represent that state in the US Congress.  Kaufman was born in Boiling Springs,  Pennsylvania,  the son of German-Jewish parents.  After graduating from Princeton College in 1833,  he studied law in Mississippi under John A. Quitman and in 1835 became a practicing attorney in Natchitoches,  Louisiana. Drawn to the Republic of Texas by its struggle for independence,  he settled in Nacogdoches in 1837.  As a Major in the local militia he fought in the Cherokee War and was seriously wounded at the Battle of Neches (July 1839),  from which he never fully recovered.  Kaufman was a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 1839 to 1843 (the last two terms as Speaker),  and the Texas Senate from 1843 to 1845.  In February 1845,  Republic President Anson Jones named him to succeed Andrew J. Donelson as Charg d'Affaires to the US; he never presented his credentials and Texas entered statehood at the end of that year.  Instead he was elected as a Democrat to represent the Eastern District of Texas in the Twenty-Ninth and two succeeding Congresses,  serving from March 1846 until his death.  During his time on Capitol Hill Kaufman was pugnacious in defending the interests of his home state.  He unsuccessfully argued that parts of what are now New Mexico,  Colorado,  Kansas,  Oklahoma,  and Wyoming rightfully belonged to Texas,  and attempted to persuade Governor Peter H. Bell to have the State Militia invade Santa Fe.  He did gain concessions from the Compromise of 1850,  in which the federal government assumed the debts of the former Republic.  In his final term he was Chairman of the Committee on Rules.  Kaufman died at 37 in Washington,  DC and was originally buried at Congressional Cemetery;  he was reinterred at the State Cemetery in Austin in 1932.

"Burial: Texas State Cemetery Austin Travis County Texas, USA ","Civil War Confederate General. An 1826 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, he first served at Sackett's Harbor in New York before being transferred to the 6th United States Regular Infantry regiment at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, operating as regimental adjunct during the Black Hawk War. He married Henrietta Preston in 1829, and after being forced to resign his commission in 1834 to take care of his ailing wife, he set up a farm near St Louis where he cared for her until she died in the summer of 1835.The next year  he moved to Texas and enlisted in the Texas militia. By August, he was appointed Adjutant General and in 1837 was promoted to Brigadier General in command of the entire Texas army. After a duel with the man he replaced, he was injured in the leg and was unable to take his new command. On December 1838, he was named the Secretary of War of the Republic of Texas by President Mirabeau B. Lamar and concerned himself with fighting the Cherokee along the eastern border. After his term expired in 1840, he returned to Kentucky and lived there several years, marrying Eliza Griffin on October 3, 1843. Shortly afterwards the two moved back to Texas and settled at the China Grove Plantation in Brazoria County. With the outbreak of the Mexican War, he reenlisted in the United States Army, and was commissioned as Colonel of the 1st Texas Rifle Volunteers and served in Monterrey, Mexico as inspector general. From 1849 to 1860 he was assigned to various duties over the western frontier; from the Indian fighting in the Great Plains in 1855 to escorting the Mormons to Salt Lake City from 1858 to 1860. By the end of 1860, he was working in the Pacific Department of the Army in San Francisco, California. Upon hearing that Texas had seceded and sided with the Confederacy at the outset of the Civil War, Johnston resigned his commission and returned home. Enlisting in the Confederate army upon arrival, he was appointed a Brigadier General by Confederate President Jefferson Davis and assigned command of the Western Department. Taking Bowling Green, Kentucky as his base of operations, he called for volunteers and worked on honing them into soldiers. After moving his base to Corinth, Mississippi, he led his men at the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh, by all accounts performing brilliantly on the field until his natural eagerness for involvement led him to ride too far ahead of his troops. He was shot, like Stonewall Jackson later would be, by his own men. Hit behind his right knee in the same leg he had been wounded in the duel many years ago in Texas, the nerve injury from the duel did not give him notice how severe this wound was. The bullet had severed an artery and Johnston's boot filled with blood. After first ordering his medics to tend to the others, he started feeling faint and his men had to help him dismount from his horse. Once his men carried him to a small ravine out of range of the Union soldiers, Albert Johnston died on the Shiloh battlefield on April 6, 1862 of massive blood loss. The man whom Jefferson Davis called the Confederacy's finest general was laid to rest in New Orleans until 1867 when he was re-interred at the Texas State Cemetery with full honors in recognition of his service to Texas.

John Hughes was born on February 11, 1855 in Henry County, Illinois; he was only able to attend school on rare occasions since he was kept busy working the family farm. In 1869, he left the farm to work on a cattle ranch, but left soon after and headed out to Indian Territory where he would live with the Choctaw, Osage and Comanches as a respected trader near Ft Sill, Oklahoma. In 1880 he left the area and moved to Liberty Hill, Texas where he ran his own property. Six years later, he was able to use the skills he learned as a trapper to track several men who had stolen horses from him and his neighbors, following them as far as New Mexico. Finding them after months of searching, he was able to kill several of the thieves, some of whom were loose members of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch. After he returned the stolen horses to his neighbors, word of his adventure reached the Texas Rangers and he was sworn in on August 10, 1887. Assigned to Camp Wood in Company D, Frontier Battalion, he spent his time patrolling the Texas-Mexico border watching for smugglers and outlaws trying to flee the country. When his unit was abolished in 1900, he was made captain of Company D, then senior captain, working out of the Ranger headquarters in Austin. Around this time, the Western novelist Zane Grey heard of his exploits in the Rangers and started to ride with him, listening to his stories of gunfights and trail drives, eventually writing the book ""The Lone Star Ranger"" in 1914, dedicating the book to Hughes and his fellow lawmen. The title character was the model for the later cultural icon The Lone Ranger, and was based almost entirely on Hughes' exploits; it can be argued that John Hughes was the Lone Ranger. By 1915, he had served as a Texas Ranger for twenty-eight years, longer than any other man, and on January 31, retired from service. He enjoyed spending his later years as a casual prospector and driving his new automobile around his homestead property in El Paso. In 1940 he became the first recipient of the Certificate of Valor, awarded to him for his excellent lifetime service as a peace officer. Growing weaker with age, forced to live with family in Austin, John Hughes took his own life on June 3, 1947 at the age of ninety-two.

He joined the Texas National Guard in 1884, attained the rank of Colonel before resigning in 1893, and raised a cavalry troop for the First US Volunteer Cavalry (the Rough Riders) during the Spanish-American War, but did not mobilize with them.  From 1902 to 1910 he was US Marshal for eastern Texas.  Houston ran for office unsuccessfully several times as a Republican and Prohibition party candidate.  In 1922 he was named Superintendent of the San Jacinto Battleground State Park.  In April 1941 Governor  W. Lee O'Daniel  appointed Houston to the US Senate to fill the vacancy caused by  Morris Sheppard 's death.  O'Daniel intended to run for the seat in the ensuing special election and named Houston as a placeholder, making the 87 year old the oldest person to ever become a Senator (though some already-serving Senators have been older).  The trip to Washington, DC for his swearing in had a negative effect on his health and he served just two months before dying at a Baltimore, Maryland hospital.

"Burial: Oakwood Cemetery Austin Travis County Texas, USA ","Governor of Texas. Born near Rusk, Cherokee County, Texas, he was the first native born Texan to become governor. Orphaned by 1863, he had little money and had to go to work before getting more than a basic education. After the Civil War, he went to school in Alabama. After returning to Texas, he worked as a typesetter in a newspaper office at Rusk where he perfected his spelling, improved his vocabulary, and was stimulated by the prose and poetry contributions of his brother who was studying law. He was a typesetter for the ""Rusk Chronicle"", later ran the ""Longview News"" and founded the ""Quitman News"". He was admitted (1875) to the Texas bar, and was Wood County's county attorney (1879 to 1881), district attorney (1881 to 1885), and state attorney general (1887 to 1891). Hogg suffered his only political defeat in 1876 when he ran for a seat in the Texas legislature. Hogg won election as 20th Governor of Texas in 1890, serving in this capacity from 1891 to 1895. During his second term, his administration endorsed three constitutional amendments. Voters defeated the proposals to charter state banks and to provide a pension for indigent Confederate veterans, but approved the amendment to allow for public election of the railroad commissioners. At his urging, the legislature passed a law allowing the Railroad Commission to fix rates based on fair valuation and to stop many of the practices the railroad companies had used to manipulate stocks. In 1895 he retired from political life to practice law, first in Austin, and finally in Houston. Although he was not wealthy when he left office, through his connections he became involved in land and oil deals and amassed a large fortune.

"Burial: Texas State Cemetery Austin Travis County Texas, USA ","United States Senator. Mexican War Major General. First Governor of Texas. James Henderson was a scholarly man, first attending Lincoln Academy, then the University of North Carolina; after graduating, he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1829 at the age of twenty-one. He developed an interest in the military and enlisted as a major in the North Carolina militia, where he impressed his superiors to the point that he was promoted to colonel in the span of a few months. After moving to Mississippi in 1835, he heard of the Texas revolution and began recruiting his fellow citizens into volunteers to fight against Mexico. Arriving in Texas with his company in June 1836, he was commissioned a brigadier general of the Texas army by ad interim president David Burnet who took advantage of Henderson's speaking ability by sending him back to the states to recruit more volunteers. Returning to North Carolina, he quickly rounded up another company and sent them to Texas, reportedly paying for the cost himself. Upon his arrival back to Texas in November 1836, he was appointed Attorney General of the new Republic and the following month replaced Stephen Austin as the Secretary of State. In the early spring of 1837, he was named ambassador to England and France and was given the task of getting official recognition from them of the Republic of Texas as an independent country. He succeeded, and both countries entered into trade and alliance agreements with the Republic. Henderson returned to Texas in 1840 after marrying Frances Cox, whom he had met in London, and set up his law practice in San Augustine. Four years later, he was called upon to travel to Washington DC to aid in negotiating annexation with the United States; however, when the United States Senate rejected the initial treaty, he was recalled by Texas president Sam Houston. On November 1845, after Texas had been accepted as the 28th state, James Henderson was elected its first governor. He was so well-respected in office that one of the new districts was named Henderson County in his honor in 1846. At the outset of the Mexican War, he asked the Texas senate permission to take command of the Texas volunteers on the front lines of the battlefield. He was given such, and led the Second Texas Regiment at the Battle of Monterrey, later negotiating for the surrender of the city. From July to October 1846 he was given the rank of major general of the Texas volunteers by the United States. In late 1846 he resumed his position of governor until the end of his term in 1847 and returned to his law practice. Ten years later he was elected to the United States Senate on November 9, 1857 and served there until his death on June 4, 1858. First laid to rest in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, he was later re-interred in 1930 to the Texas State Cemetery with full honors in recognition of his service to the Republic and state of Texas.

His father and uncle were Thomas and Bailey Hardeman, respected frontiersmen and soldiers during the War of 1812, and his mother Mary was the aunt of United States president James K Polk. Brought up in privilege, he attended the University of Nashville and in 1835 moved with the rest of the large Hardeman clan to Texas. Like his relations, he quickly became involved in the Texas secession movement, first fighting in the Battle of Gonzales, then as part of a relief troop sent to the Alamo, albeit arriving after the Alamo had fallen. He fell ill during an assignment to recruit more troops, keeping him from participating in the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. Once Texas had won its independence, he signed on with the Texas Rangers and fought Indians in the west Texas frontier from 1837 to 1842, notably at Wallace's Creek, the Cordova campaign and the Battle of Plum Creek. Once Texas was annexed into the United States, he joined the Guadalupe Valley Rangers under Zachary Taylor as a scout and fought in the Mexican War at Encarnacion and Buena Vista. Once a truce was declared, he headed home to his plantation in Guadalupe County and worked his estate. In 1861, Texas voted to side with the Confederate cause during the U.S. Civil War, and William returned to military service after fifteen years of retirement. He built a force of over eight hundred men from his neighboring counties, forming the Fourth Texas Cavalry Regiment under General Henry Sibley.

He spent his early years working the property with his father, who had been influential in both North Carolina and Tennessee in constitutional politics, then began his adult life as a merchant and a deputy sheriff before finally studying law and setting up his own practice. At the outbreak of the War of 1812, he enlisted as an artillery officer under Andrew Jackson and served in Louisiana. He married Rebecca Wilson in 1820 and spent the next several years on the frontier as a trapper, helping to open up the Santa Fe trading route, from 1821 to 1825. He returned home to his Williamson County, Tennessee estate and spent his money endowing the Hardeman Academy, donating land to the local church and opening a store and a tavern. In 1835, Bailey, his two brothers Thomas and Blackstone and his sister Julia moved their families to Texas where they quickly became involved in the Texas independence movement. He helped to secure a cannon and brought it to the battlegrounds of San Antonio, then was appointed to help organize the Matagorda area militia.

Logan landed with the first wave of the assault echelon on the beaches of the Gulf of Salerno, and after his company had advanced 800 yards inland and taken positions along the forward bank of an irrigation canal, the enemy began a serious counterattack from positions along a rock wall which ran parallel with the canal about 200 yards further inland. Voluntarily exposing himself to the fire of a machinegun located along the rock wall, which sprayed the ground so close to him that he was splattered with dirt and rock splinters from the impact of the bullets, Sgt. Logan killed the first 3 Germans as they came through a gap in the wall. He then attacked the machinegun. As he dashed across the 200 yards of exposed terrain a withering stream of fire followed his advance. Reaching the wall, he crawled along the base, within easy reach of the enemy crouched  along the opposite side, until he reached the gun. Jumping up, he shot the 2 gunners down, hurdled the wall, and  seized the gun. Swinging it around, he immediately opened fire on the enemy with the remaining ammunition, raking their flight and inflicting further casualties on them as they fled. After smashing the machinegun over the rocks, Sgt. Logan captured an enemy officer and private who were attempting to sneak away. Later in the morning, Sgt. Logan went after a sniper hidden in a house about 150 yards from the company. Again the intrepid Sgt. ran a gauntlet of fire to reach his objective. Shooting the lock off the door, Sgt. Logan kicked it in and shot the sniper who had just reached the bottom of the stairs. The conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity which characterized Sgt.

He personally led 2 companies of Louisiana infantry in a charge that captured 5 guns of Colonel Franz Sigel's command and routed the Union force. Because of casualties and lack of ammunition, his forces did not follow up their advantage. He was a frontier fighter with little regard for formal military protocol or theory and usually wore a black velvet suit in the field. He feuded with Major General Sterling Price, with whom he was teamed at Wilson's Creek and other engagements. Friction between the two was eased by the appointment of Major General Earl Van Dorn as commander of the Trans-Mississippi District early in 1862.

He persevered in his efforts to improve his new homeland, becoming a captain of Texas Rangers in January 1836. Elected to represent the Milam region for the Convention of 1836 to discuss the coming secession and war with Mexico, he became one of the signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence in March.

"Burial: Stevie Ray Vaughan Memorial Austin Travis County Texas, USA *Memorial Site  ","Rock/Blues Musician. Born in Dallas, Texas, he was part of a musical family.  His elder brother Jimmie,  the guitarist in the group The Fabulous Thunderbirds, introduced his younger brother to rock and blues via his record collection. Stevie Ray Vaughan came to appreciate guitarists such as B.B. King, Albert King, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and many others, by listening to their recordings. He learned to play by borrowing brother Jimmie's guitar and following him to his concerts.  By 1975, Stevie Ray was a member of the Cobras, followed by Triple Threat, a band that evolved into Double Trouble. The band recorded ""Texas Flood"" for Epic records, an album that showed his widening interests. After it's release, he and the band were huge in the blues/rock scene, and the album won a string of awards internationally. A subsequent period of personal decline ended with Stevie Ray Vaughan collapsing on stage in 1986 due to alcohol and drugs overindulgence. Three years later, after an intensive rehabilitation, he was back on top form on ""In Step"", an album evidencing maturity and musicianship. He then recorded ""Family Style"" with brother Jimmie.  Before the album's release, Stevie Ray Vaughan was killed in a private-helicopter crash, in a thick fog in Wisconsin, after leaving a concert at which he'd appeared with Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton and Robert Cray.

"Burial: Oakwood Cemetery Austin Travis County Texas, USA ","5th &amp; 13th Governor of Texas. Born in Enfield, Connecticut, he studied at Westfield Academy in Massachusetts. He held several minor positions in Connecticut, including that of clerk in the post office in Hartford. In 1834 he starting looking for new opportunities and traveled west. He arrived in Texas in early 1835, settling in Mina. He studied law and became quite involved with the developing Texas Revolution. He hoped for conciliation with Mexico even while becoming secretary of a committee of safety in Mina; however, he changed his position and participated in the first battle of the revolution at Gonzales. He became secretary to the General Council of the Provisional Government and attended the convention at Washington-on-the-Brazos in March of 1836. During this convention, he helped write part of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas. He became chief clerk of the navy and treasury departments, successively, of the ad interim government. He also served as clerk of the judiciary committee of the House of Representatives. He was one of the major contributors in writing the new nation's criminal code. In the fall of 1836, he turned down the position of postmaster general in order to return to his study of law. Passing the bar in April 1837, Pease became the republic's first comptroller of public accounts. He then took up the practice of law at Brazoria and soon became successful and respected in his profession. After annexation, he represented Brazoria County in the first three legislatures and authored the Probate Code of 1846. In 1851 he made an unsuccessful run for the governorship. Two years later he won the office and was reelected in 1855. Among his achievements was to persuade the legislature to establish a system of public education and a state university. His administration did establish the permanent school fund and his vision laid the groundwork for future achievement. He also worked to encourage railroad construction in Texas, to put the state penitentiary on a self-supporting basis, and to establish reservations to civilize and educate the state's Indian population. In addition, he supervised the building campaign that led to the completion of the Governor's Mansion, the General Land Office building, the State Orphan's Home (now the Corsicana State Home), and a new Capital building. Perhaps his most significant accomplishment was the settlement of the public debt of the state, by which he made available funds for the establishment of a hospital for the mentally ill and schools for the deaf and blind ,all of which he had recommended to the legislature. Upon his retirement from office in 1857, the state was in excellent financial condition. In 1859 Pease aligned himself with the Unionist faction in Texas politics. He remained active in this movement into the early months of the Civil War, during which he was quietly loyal to the Union. In 1866 he lost a bid to become governor again in the first election of the Reconstruction era. Early in 1867 he helped organize the Republican party in Texas. Later that year, the incumbent Governor was removed for office and Pease was appointed in his place. His efforts to reorganize the state government and bring accountability to its actions were met by conflict within the Republican ranks and bitterness toward the chief executive by the former Confederate majority in the state. He resigned from the governorship in 1869 because of differences over Reconstruction policies that he considered radical and despotic. During the remainder of his life, he remained interested in political affairs of the state, and was president of the non-partisan Tax-payers' Convention of 1871. In 1872, he was chairman of the Texas delegation to the national Liberal Republican convention. In 1879 President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Pease to the collector of customs at Galveston. In the closing years of his life Pease practiced law in Austin, engaged in various business ventures, and lived a quiet life with his family. He died from an attack of apoplexy and was buried in Austin.

A native of Fort Worth, Texas, O'Brien served as a Second Lieutenant, United States Marine Corps Reserve, Company H, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division. O'Brien was awarded his Medal of Honor for action at Korea on October 27, 1952, during the Korean War. O'Brien's citation reads: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a rifle platoon commander of Company H, in action against enemy aggressor forces. With his platoon subjected to an intense mortar and artillery bombardment while preparing to assault a vitally important hill position on the main line of resistance which had been overrun by a numerically superior enemy force on the preceding night, 2nd Lt. O'Brien leaped from his trench when the attack signal was given and, shouting for his men to follow, raced across an exposed saddle and up the enemy-held hill through a virtual hail of deadly small-arms, artillery, and mortar fire. Although shot through the arm and thrown to the ground by hostile automatic-weapons fire as he neared the well-entrenched enemy position, he bravely regained his feet, waved his men onward, and continued to spearhead the assault, pausing only long enough to go to the aid of a wounded marine. Encountering the enemy at close range, he proceeded to hurl handgrenades into the bunkers and, utilizing his carbine to best advantage in savage hand-to-hand combat, succeeded in killing at least 3 of the enemy. Struck down by the concussion of grenades on 3 occasions during the subsequent action, he steadfastly refused to be evacuated for medical treatment and continued to lead his platoon in the assault for a period of nearly 4 hours, repeatedly encouraging his men and maintaining superb direction of the unit. With the attack halted he set up a defense with his remaining forces to prepare for a counterattack, personally checking each position, attending to the wounded and expediting their evacuation. When a relief of the position was effected by another unit, he remained to cover the withdrawal and to assure that no wounded were left behind. By his exceptionally daring and forceful leadership in the face of overwhelming odds, 2nd Lt. O'Brien served as a constant source of inspiration to all who observed him and was greatly instrumental in the recapture of a strategic position on the main line of resistance. His indomitable determination and valiant fighting spirit reflect the highest credit upon himself and enhance the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.
